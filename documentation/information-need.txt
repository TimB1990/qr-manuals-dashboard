The application has roles 'user' and 'admin'. The user should be able to scan an QR-code that references the user a view that shows the productid, producttype (screenwiper), productname. If the user has no camera for qr-scanning he can also search the product by a given productID

In this view the user can see if the product is in stock, or can download the the usermanual (PDF), the technical documentation (PDF). In the same view the user can also request a quote (offerte) or can order the product directly online. Either way the user can also choose to scan a different product.

Also when the user has requested a quote for the product, or has ordered the product, the administrator must see them in an overview. Meanwhile an email has been sended to user with the confirmation.
